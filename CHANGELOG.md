## sylph v0.1.0 release - 2023-09-XX

###Major

- Added `--pseudotax` option, similar to the `-w` option in mash screen, where k-mers are assigned to the highest ANI genome so redundancy is removed. The output is a very rough taxonomic classification of the sample. 

###Minor

- Some fixes and parameter changes from the v0.0.x releases.
